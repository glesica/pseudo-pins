# Pseudo Pins

A Chrome extension that automatically rearranges tabs based on a set of regular
expressions provided by the user. This mimics, in a way, the "pin" behavior
built into Chrome since tabs that match a given expression are moved as far to
the left as possible and grouped together.

The extension attempts, within reason, to maintain its arrangements.
